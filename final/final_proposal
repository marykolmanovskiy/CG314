i'm not 100% set on this, but i'd like to consider using data and time together (as the sketch goes through ~1942-1945, 
the appropriate data appears). i think conceptually, i'd like for the goal to be to help visualize/understand/sympathize 
with the large number of people involved in ww2 (focused on americans).

i'd also like to add interactive elements using pictures and info to make it more educational. (having it be educational 
is another goal for the final)
(i'll look more into the second link that you sent)
