I'd like to make a tamagotchi type of game where you take care of some kinda creature for however long you have the window open. It'd be fairly fast paced since there's no save, and I think it'd be mostly dependent on button and time (millis) functions. If I end up having spare time, I'd like to have a selection phase in the beginning where you can choose your creature from a selection of 2 or 3.
